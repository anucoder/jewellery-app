        <q className="quote-text f-small">Absolutely love how dainty and feminine the chain is on my Mable bracelet. So happy with this purchase and very excited to see a brand focused on silver tone vs. gold. Also, love the fact that it does not tarnish, I’ve worn mine several times while washing my hands and dishes - no colour change so far. Thank you Mable Jewelry!</q>

        <q className="quote-text f-small">When I received my order I was even more pleased with the necklace in person - it’s so sparkly, and dainty so it’s beautiful on its own but also great for layering. This has become a staple piece in my accessories wardrobe, and I can’t wait to add to my collection! They are also excellent gifts for anybody on your list because they are so versatile. 5 stars!!</q>

        <q className="quote-text f-small">I bought the olive pendant for my sister for her birthday coming up. It is beyond what I expected—the quality, the packaging and the whole aesthetic. My sister loves dainty jewelry, and we have a dog named “Olive” so it’s also very sentimental. Thank you Mable Jewelry for having the perfect gift!! Can’t wait to get one for myself!</q>
